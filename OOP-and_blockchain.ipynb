    "\n",
    "Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, an object could represent a person with a name property, age, address, etc., with behaviors like walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or an email with properties like recipient list, subject, body, etc., and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things like cars as well as relations between things like companies and employees, students and teachers, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something. In the case of an animal, we could create an Animal() class to track properties about the Animal like the name and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that a class just provides structure—it’s a blueprint for how something should be defined, but it doesn’t actually provide any real content itself. The Animal() class may specify that the name and age are necessary for defining an animal, but it will not actually state what a specific animal’s name or age is.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may help to think of a class as an idea for how something should be defined."

    "Create a simplified version of Black Jack (Ace counts as 1, no stakes, no insurance and no split). To do so, create a deck of cards class. Internally, the deck of cards should use another class, a card class. Your requirements are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The Deck class should have a deal method to deal a single card from the deck\n",
    " - After a card is dealt, it is removed from the deck.\n",
    " - There should be a shuffle method which makes sure the deck of cards has all 52 cards and then rearranges them randomly.\n",
    " - The Card class should have a suit (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades), a value (A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K) and the corresponding points from black Jack as attributes\n",
